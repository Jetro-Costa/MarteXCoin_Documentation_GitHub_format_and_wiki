===============

Creating a new wallet
---------------------

When you first start the official MarteX wallet for android, you need to click on create a new wallet, after that it will show you the recovery phrase and ask if you have already backed it up. You should keep it in the keepass for example.

Then, you will be asked to create a password to access the wallet so that third parties do not use your cell phone. This step is optional, however, it is safer to implement the password.
After that, you must select MarteXcoin as the currency to be used.
Then the terms of service will be displayed in which you must read and agree to use the wallet.
It is then released for use.
