======================
Arguments and commands
======================

All command-line options (except for ``-datadir`` and ``-conf``) may be
specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options
may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override
values set in the configuration file. The configuration file is a list
of ``setting=value`` pairs, one per line, with optional comments
starting with the ``#`` character.

The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it
using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, martex-qt (or martexd)
will look for a file named ``MarteX.conf`` in the martex data directory, but
both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed
using the -datadir and -conf command-line arguments.

+----------+--------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

be appended to the data directory automatically.

martexd
-------

MarteX Core Daemon version v3.0.6.1-a4933cd-dirty


Usage:
^^^^^^

martexd [options]
  Start MarteX Core Daemon


Options:
^^^^^^^^

--help                              Print this help message and exit
--version                           Print version and exit

--blocknotify=<cmd>                 Execute command when the best block changes (%s in cmd is replaced by block hash)
--assumevalid=<hex>                 If this block is in the chain assume that it and its ancestors are valid and potentially skip their script verification (0 to verify all, default: 00299e02c3418ef5afadf1c1d6b0e529f4d169428d9cf6cbbbb8baaa388963b4, testnet:8ad40d557632ce92ac361c5c8407a2364431c94167e52e9f4f23d09b0161e379)
--conf=<file>                       Specify configuration file (default: MarteX.conf)
--daemon                            Run in the background as a daemon and accept commands
--datadir=<dir>                     Specify data directory
--dbcache=<n>                       Set database cache size in megabytes (4 to 16384, default: 300)

This mode is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. Warning: Reverting this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain.
