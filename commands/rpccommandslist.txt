	fundrawtransaction "hexstring" ( options )
Add inputs to a transaction until it has enough in value to meet its out value.
This will not modify existing inputs, and will add at most one change output to the outputs.
No existing outputs will be modified unless "subtractFeeFromOutputs" is specified.
Note that inputs which were signed may need to be resigned after completion since in/outputs have been added.
The inputs added will not be signed, use signrawtransaction for that.
Note that all existing inputs must have their previous output transaction be in the wallet.
Note that all inputs selected must be of standard form and P2SH scripts must be
in the wallet using importaddress or addmultisigaddress (to calculate fees).
You can see whether this is the case by checking the "solvable" field in the listunspent output.
Only pay-to-pubkey, multisig, and P2SH versions thereof are currently supported for watch-only

Arguments:
1. "hexstring"           (string, required) The hex string of the raw transaction
2. options                 (object, optional)

     "lockUnspents"           (boolean, optional, default false) Lock selected unspent outputs
     "reserveChangeKey"       (boolean, optional, default true) Reserves the change output key from the keypool
     "feeRate"                (numeric, optional, default not set: makes wallet determine the fee) Set a specific feerate (MXT per KB)
     "subtractFeeFromOutputs" (array, optional) A json array of integers.
                              The fee will be equally deducted from the amount of each specified output.
                              The outputs are specified by their zero-based index, before any change output is added.
                              Those recipients will receive less martex than you enter in their corresponding amount field.
                              If no outputs are specified here, the sender pays the fee.
                                  [vout_index,...]
   }
                         for backward compatibility: passing in a true instead of an object will result in {"includeWatching":true}

	lockunspent unlock ([{"txid":"txid","vout":n},...])
Updates list of temporarily unspendable outputs.
Temporarily lock (unlock=false) or unlock (unlock=true) specified transaction outputs.
If no transaction outputs are specified when unlocking then all current locked transaction outputs are unlocked.
A locked transaction output will not be chosen by automatic coin selection, when spending martexs.
Locks are stored in memory only. Nodes start with zero locked outputs, and the locked output list
is always cleared (by virtue of process exit) when a node stops or fails.
Also see the listunspent call

1. unlock            (boolean, required) Whether to unlock (true) or lock (false) the specified transactions
