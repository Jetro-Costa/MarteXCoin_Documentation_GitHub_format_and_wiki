Shared Masternodes Services
===========================

Several members of the MarteX community offer masternode shared masternodes services. 
This service cannot be performed safely without the customer giving up on
5000 MARTEX control required for warranty. For security reasons,
it is highly recommended to keep guarantees in a hardware portfolio
while taking advantage of a hosting service, unfortunately, 
there is still no hardware wallet for MarteXcoin. A list of
the available masternode hosting services are available below.
